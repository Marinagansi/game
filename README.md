# The Adventure
"The Adventurer" is an offline 2D single player shooting and survival game produced by 404 NOT Found, a group of five Softwarica College of IT and E-Commerce students. The game is about an adventurer who gets lost and must return home, but in-order to do so, he must encounter and defeat many monsters. When he defeats the adversaries in one world and completes the level, he will be transported to another world in the form of a different character, each one more challenging than the last. He will be able to return home if he has completed all of the obstacles and survived all of the adversaries. As the level of the game rises, so does the difficulty. To reach the goal, the players must overcome all obstacles.
## Aim
Shooting the enemy to be in-game, defeating all the obstacles in-order to complete the levels, and achieving high score by collecting health-kits.\
